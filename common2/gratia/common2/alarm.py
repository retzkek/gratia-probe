class Alarm:
    """
    This class tracks a single alarm condition's status, sending messages
    to the administrator list when alarm events occur more frequently than
    the specified threshold. The code that uses this should call event()
    each time an alarm event occurs. It should call reset() if the alarm
    condition goes away.
    """

    # Alarm Constructor
    #
    # @param smtpServer is the name of the SMTP server host via which emails
    #        are sent. 'localhost' is frequently adequate.
    # @param fromAddress is the email address that will appear in the From:
    #        line of the email messages.
    # @param toAddressList is a list of email addresses to which an email
    #        will be sent if a warning is triggered.
    # @param subject is the subject line of the email message that will be
    #        sent if a warning is triggered.
    # @param messageText is the message that will be sent to the email list
    #        if the alarm event occurs too frequently.
    # @param threshold is the number of times the alarm can be reported,
    #        without an intervening reset, before a warning email should be
    #        sent. If set to zero, it will send an email for each event, except
    #        that it won't send emails for events that occur within the
    #        repeatTimeLimit.
    # @param repeatTimeLimit is the time in seconds within which a second
    #        email warning will not be sent. I.e., if an alarm event occurs that
    #        triggers an email, then no new email will be sent if the alarm
    #        event recurs during the next repeatTimeLimit seconds. If sset to
    #        zero, it will send an email every time the threshold is exceeded.
    # @param resetAfterWarning is a boolean value. If true, then the event
    #        count will be set back to zero after a warning is issued.
