Steps to install AWS-gratia-probe:

1.	First you need to get the rpm file from the osg site. The rpm name being 
	gratia-probe-awsvm-(% VERSION).el6.noarch.rpm
2.	Install the rpm - this will prompt u to install also its dependency 
	gratia-probe-common-(% VERSION).el6.noarch.rpm 
A)	This will again prompt you to install PyOpenSSL
	yum install PyOpenSSL
3.	It will also prompt you to install pip and boto3
A)	download the rpm for pip using
	rpm -ivh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
B)  	and yum install it
	yum install -y python-pip
C)	Next install the boto3 package using pip
	pip install boto3
4.	Boto3 needs the aws credentials file containing the IAM Access ID and Key inorder to access the AWS console.
A)	create a ".aws" directory 
	mkdir ~/.aws
B)	create file named credentials 
	vi ~/.aws/credentials
c)	And put the access id and key in the format
	[default]
	aws_access_key_id = AKIXXXXXXXXXXXXXXCOA
	aws_secret_access_key = bFSXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX3ey
5.	Next modify the ProbeConfig file
	vi /etc/gratia/awsvm/ProbeConfig 
A)	Modify the host name and ports to point to the gratia server like below
	CollectorHost="fermicloud054.fnal.gov:8880"
    	SSLHost="fermicloud054.fnal.gov:8443"
   	SSLRegistrationHost="fermicloud054.fnal.gov:8080"
B)	Also enable the probe by setting below to one
	EnableProbe="1"
c)	Also enable Excempt duplicates in order to prevent probe from sending records more than once per hour using
	ExcemptDuplicates="1"
	Save the changes to config file
6.	Next we need to add the probe's cron to the system cron and enable it
A)	add the cron
	chkconfig --add gratia-probes-cron
B)	Enable the cron
	chkconfig gratia-probes-cron on
c)	Check its status
	chkconfig --list gratia-probes-cron
D)	also start the service
	service gratia-probes-cron start
7.	The aws-gratia-probe is started and will run every one hour 
	we can check the logs in 
	vi /var/logs/gratia/(%date).log



ALSO INCASE ANY ERRORS ARE THROWN BY THE PROBE DURING RUNTIME
OR IF THE PROBE DOESNT EXECUTE PROPERLY
1.	IF the excempt duplicates is set and the filelock throws erros 
	check whether the filelock file exists at
	/var/lib/gratia/filelock
	and also where it is set properly in ProbeConfig file
	DuplicateFilelock="/var/lib/gratia/filelock"
2.	If it says hardwareinst doesnt exist check whether the file exists and the value is it properly in probe
	HardwareDetails="/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/gratia/awsvm/hardwareinst"
3.	If u need to add or update the values to the table in hardwareinst plf follow the syntax
	instance-type(\tab)vcpu(\tab)ram(\tab)price(\tab)(\newline)
	value1(\tab)value2(\tab)value3(\tab)value4(\tab)(\newline)
	eg : m3.medium(\tab)1(\tab)3.75(\tab)0.067(\tab)(\newline)
